This repo is the codes to [Data-Driven Distributionally Robust CVaR Portfolio Optimization Under A Regime-Switching Ambiguity Set](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/msom.2023.1229).


The overall pipeline document and guidance is in the ``code/portfolio_experiment_demiguel.ipynb`` and ``portfolio_experiment_final_version.ipynb``. Detailed user guides are listed in the corresponding notebook files.

We have sample data in the ``factor model`` folder. Other data used in our paper can be downloaded from Kenneth French website. For the regimes data, we have processed through other tools and the regimes estimated from bull and bear, weathers and hidden markov data in the ``*.state.csv``.
